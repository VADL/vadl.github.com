The Vanderbilt SL rocketry and safety mentor is Robin Midgett, a member of the National Association of Rocketry who holds Level 2 certification. In conjunction with Dexter (NAR Level 1) and Ben, our student Safety Officer, Robin will oversee the rocketry team to ensure safety precautions are taken during the design, construction, testing, and storage of all rocket materials and equipment. During the course of the year, other members of the Vanderbilt SL team may pursue various NAR certifications as well.
