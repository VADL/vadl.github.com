## What is Git?

Git is a version control system (VCS) which exists as a distributed tree based repository.  It's used for storing and versioning documents and code, and allows you to at any time retrieve any of the files from any of the current or past versions of the repository.  It also has features like file locking to ensure that only one person at a time can make edits to a file, automatic merging for when two users make changes to the same file at the same time but don't conflict with each other, and assisted merging for when two users make changes to the same part of the same file at the same time.  Most importantly Git is useful for never losing your work by not only backing it up in the cloud but by also ensuring that you can always revert back to a pervious version on a per-file/folder/repository basis.

## How to install Git

If you're working with [Github](http://www.github.com), which you probably are, and you don't want to learn command line interfaces, which you probably don't, then you should just simplify your life and download [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).  It's available for both Windows and OSX.

If you're on Linux, or would rather learn how to use git from the command line (which is generally faster once you get used to it), then you should simply use Git.  [Here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) is a good link which gives the basic instructions for installing Git under Linux, OSX, and Windows.
